## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at UIC studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about 3d printers, and building projects that have real-world applications. Check out some of my projects!

I'm currently working on...

- [Custom Voron 2.4](https://github.com/npebler/Voron-2.4) : Custom built Voron 2.4.  XOL toolhead, Box Turtle AMS, tuned for speed.
- Datsun 240z - Arduino based projects for different sensors, screens, and more.  Will be uploaded as they come
